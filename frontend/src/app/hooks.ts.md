### Overview

This code defines two custom React hooks: `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector`. These hooks provide a centralized way to access the `dispatch` function and the `useSelector` hook from your Redux store within your React components.  This approach simplifies Redux interactions and improves code maintainability.

### Usage

To use the custom hooks, simply import them into your React component:

```javascript
import { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from './store';
```

Then, you can use `useAppDispatch` to dispatch actions to your Redux store:

```javascript
const dispatch = useAppDispatch();

// Dispatch an action
dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
```

Similarly, you can use `useAppSelector` to access and select specific data from your Redux store:

```javascript
const count = useAppSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
```

### Example

Here's a simple example of how to use the custom hooks in a React component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from './store';

function Counter() {
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
  const count = useAppSelector((state) => state.counter.value);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Benefits

* **Centralized Redux Access:**  By defining custom hooks, you eliminate the need to repeatedly import `useDispatch` and `useSelector` in every component. This keeps your code cleaner and reduces redundancy.
* **Improved Maintainability:** When your Redux store structure changes, you only need to update the types in these hooks. This makes your code more adaptable to future changes.
* **Type Safety:** The `TypedUseSelectorHook` interface ensures type safety when selecting data from your Redux store. This helps prevent runtime errors and makes your code more robust.

### Considerations

* **Custom Type Definitions:**  Ensure that your `RootState` and `AppDispatch` types accurately reflect the structure of your Redux store.
* **Large Applications:** In very large applications, you might consider using a dedicated file for your Redux hooks to improve organization.
* **Advanced Redux Features:** If you are using more advanced Redux features like middleware or sagas, you may need to adjust how you access the `dispatch` function.
